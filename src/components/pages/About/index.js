    <p>
    I am a budding web developer residing in Austin, TX. With a background in mathematics education, I spent three years teaching secondary algebra. I have a B.B.A. in Marketing from the U.T. Austin McCombs School of Business. I recently earned a certificate from the UT Coding Boot Camp in Full Stack Web Development. I am passionate about bringing my skills in mathematics together with my knowledge of business best practices and branding in order to provide high-quality, user-friendly applications that can generate market interest. I can tackle projects utilizing the full-stack of web technologies such as React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express. I look forward to contributing to a professional team in this fast-paced and exciting industry.
